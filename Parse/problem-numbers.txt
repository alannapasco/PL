Parsing Problem 2, Extended Grammar 


1.Write a program that accepts any JSON and determines whether it
belongs to the following subset of JSON data:

  Mixed JSON (MJSON) is one of:
   -- true
   -- false
   -- [MJSON, "^",  MJSON]
   -- [MJSON, "&&", MJSON]

   ;; new expressions: 

   -- [MJSON, ">",  MJSON]
   -- Integer (small ones)
   -- [MJSON, "-",  MJSON]
   -- [MJSON, "+",  MJSON]
   

Call the function `parse`. Its result is an abstract syntax tree (of
your own design) that optionally contains a node where the given JSON
tree deviates from the desired format.


2. Write a program that accepts an AST and determines whether the
expressions "type check". If so, the result is the same AST;
otherwise the program signals an error.


3. Write a program that accepts a type-checked AST and determines its
value---using the usual meaning of all literal constants and operators.
