Write a program that accepts any JSON and determines whether it
belongs to the following subset of JSON data:

  Boolean JSON (BJSON) is one of:
   -- true
   -- false
   -- [BJSON, "^", BJSON]
   -- [BJSON, "&&", BJSON]

Call the function `parse`. Its result is an abstract syntax tree (of
your own design) that optionally contains a node where the given JSON
tree deviates from the desired format.


OPTIONALLY:

Adjust the main function to accept arbitrary JSON input j
and 
    -- returns a Boolean if j is a Boolean JSON
    -- signals an error if j is not a Boolean JSON
       (as informative as you desire)
