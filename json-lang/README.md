## JSON Syntax Language Levels


A family of toy languages with JSON-syntax for teaching a PL course where students
can choose their implementation language: 

- `main.rkt` -- copy one of the below files here to program with `#lang json-lang`
  One day I'll set up directories so that json/xyz gets students there too. 

- `main-let.rkt` -- a typed language with basic arithmetic and `let` bound variables (terminating)
- `main-fun.rkt` -- .. with `let var` and `let fun` but first-order languages (terminating)
- `main-set.rkt` -- .. with `x = exp` (terminating)
- `main-ho.rkt`  -- .. with higher-order types and recursive function defs. (non-terminating)
