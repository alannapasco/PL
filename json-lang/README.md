## JSON Syntax Language Levels


A family of toy languages with JSON-syntax for teaching a PL course where students
can choose their implementation language: 

- `main-let.rkt` -- a typed language with basic arithmetic and `let` bound variables
- `main-fun.rkt` -- a typed language with `let var` and `let fun` but first-order languages
